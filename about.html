        <h1>About me: Miika Ampe</h1>
        <p>boston to el, junior at msu in info sci for hct, goals, more about me as a person like my hobbies? I'm having really weird things happen, some are probably glitches so I'm trying to work them out so I'm just putting placeholders for now.</p>
        <p> having to delete things and rework because of them. Like why is it not showing any of the color in the coding? And why is commenting not working at all? I'm so confused these have never happened before to me, I've tried reloading a bunch. and why is this one wrapping when i had to create a new line from the p above because it was unable to wrap?</p>
