        <h1>About me: Miika Ampe</h1>
        <p>I grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, but I currently reside in East Lansing, Michigan for my college career. I am a junior at Michigan State University studying Information Science with a focus in Human-Centered Technology. <br> <br> Outside of the classroom, I love engaging in new things and meeting new people. I have joined numerous clubs, such as the MSU Club Gymnastics and the skateboarding club because those sports are both passions of mine.</p>
